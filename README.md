# 💼 Job Listings Filter

A responsive job listings app built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to filter job postings based on selected tags (e.g., role, level, languages, tools). Inspired by the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt).

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Dynamic job listings rendered from `data.json`
- ✅ Filter jobs based on selected categories
- ✅ Remove individual filters or clear all
- ✅ Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- ✅ Pure Tailwind CSS styling (no custom CSS)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Semantic structure
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and filtering logic
- **JSON** – Job listings data
